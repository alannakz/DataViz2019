## About Me

My name is Alanna Kaiser and I am an MSW candidate at the University of Michigan. In U-M's social work program, I am concentrating my studies in Social Policy and Evaluation, with a particular interest in communities and social systems. I have professional experience working in education, housing, and community-based development and neighborhood revitalization.  

### Current Work

This summer, I am working as a Measurement and Evaluation intern with Habitat for Humanity Greater San Francisco. In this role, I am specifically conducting research and implementing a program evaluation to aid the Neighborhood Revitalization (NR) and Homeowner Development Departments (HDD), respectively.  With NR, I am compiling evidence to support Habitatâ€™s work in green space improvement in the Bayview Neighborhood of San Francisco. With HDD, I am conducting an internal evaluation to map the lifecycles of each program, highlighting key stages, accompanying process documentation, and stakeholders engaged.
