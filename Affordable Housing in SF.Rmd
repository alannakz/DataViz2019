This week begins my summer field placement at Habitat for Humanity Greater San Francisco! Throughout the summer, I will be digging into affordable housing and community development issues in the Bay Area.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
